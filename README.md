# Romoto
Roku Remote Chrome Extension

This is a very simple Roku Remote that works over your local home network.
The default IP is `192.168.1.2`, this can be changed by selecting the menu button and updating the value.

There is an odd glitch, when you first open the remote and every once and again, hitting enter will send left, right, left instead. All you have to do is close and reopen it and it will work fine.
